    Opencart Extensions

WHAT IS IN THIS REPO?

  These are basic ocmod file extensions that I have been using
  recently. It is important that they are all self-contained modules
  which serve only a single purpose.

  All files relevant to the extension belong in a directory which has
  been given the same name as the ocmod <code> value.
